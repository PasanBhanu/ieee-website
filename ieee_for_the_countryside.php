                    <!-- <h1>Introduction</h1> -->
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">The project IEEE for the Countryside (ගම්මැද්දට IEEE අපි) is a collaborative effort of IEEE PES, IAS and RAS Student Branch Chapters of University of Moratuwa hand in hand with IEEE Student Branch University of Moratuwa with the hope of lending a helping hand to aspiring school students from areas far away from the capital of the country.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">The inspiration for the project came from the students of Anuradhapura Central College, Sri Lanka who strive to innovate by improving their knowledge in electronics and robotics. Their newly formed “Young Scientists Robotics Club” is a symbol of their perseverance to reach greater heights despite many obstacles. However, they have faced several hardships in their endeavours due to the lack of the necessary accessories to carry out their projects and the lack of proper knowledge in basic robotics.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">As phase I of the project, a workshop was conducted with the participation of over 70 secondary students of Anuradhapura Central College. The session consisted of an Introduction to Robotics, Arduino Programming, Introduction to Sensors & Actuators followed by Hands-on experience on Programming, and finally a Fun Quiz (Kahoot) to test their knowledge.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">A handout on Arduino was designed by the volunteers prior to the session which was distributed to the students, teachers and “Little Scientists Robotics Club” of the school. It was observed that all students found the handout enthralling and useful.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">It is noteworthy that some students who were there in the audience have never used a computer before due to the lack of facilities in their homes. Hence, it is needless to mention that the program was able to make a profound impact and provide a source of inspiration to all students to achieve greater heights despite their backgrounds.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">Phase II of this project is planned to be carried out in the near future.</p>
