                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">Moratuwa Engineering Research Conference (MERCon) is the international conference organized by the Engineering Research Unit (ERU) of the University of Moratuwa in collaboration with University of Moratuwa and IEEE Student Branch of University of Moratuwa. This is an International Multidisciplinary Engineering Research Conference which is held every year with the participation of both local and foreign researchers. MERCon is co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Sri Lankan Section, Sri Lanka Section Chapter of IEEE Power and Energy Society, Sri Lanka Section Chapter of IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, Faculty of Graduate Studies of the University of Moratuwa and financially sponsored by National Science Foundation. </p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">MERCon has been successfully held for five consecutive years proving the increased success of the event year by year. This event is appreciated by many as this research conference provides a stage for undergraduates, graduates and enthusiastic researchers to present their work to an international audience and be recognized by a well-reputed panel. MERCon solicits research papers describing significant and innovative research contributions in all disciplines of engineering.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">MERCon 2018 was the fourth edition of the international conference organized by the ERU. ERU Symposium, the predecessor of MERCon, has 20 years of history as the Annual Symposium on Research for Industry. Till the 17th symposium, presentations were based on a review of the abstracts only. 18th and 19th symposia were advanced as the National Engineering Research symposium with full paper submissions. With lessons learned, the 20th ERU symposium was transformed as the MERCon 2015 to publish peer-reviewed research papers from international authors.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">MERCon provides a valuable experience for IEEE volunteers as well by allowing them to engage with the participants of the conference. The organizing, making arrangements, handling event tasks and managing the sessions and the crowd provide volunteers with a chance to sharpen their professional skills as well as soft skills.
</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">In addition to the main conference, MERCon also co-hosted the “ERU Symposium” – MERCon’s predecessor aimed at stimulating and fostering student research through the publication of peer-reviewed extended abstracts.</p>
