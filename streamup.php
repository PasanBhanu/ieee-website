                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">This project was carried out in two phases where the first phase consisted of a session which was organized in collaboration with the Center for IT Services (CITeS), University of Moratuwa and conducted by Eng. Sanjaya Sooriyaarachchi. The session covered the aspects of camera and tripod functions, preparation of tripod, camera settings configurations and lighting. The participants obtained hands-on experience in handling the videography equipment.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">Phase II of this project covered the essentials of video editing and was conducted by the Chairman of IEEE IAS SBC University of Moratuwa himself, Mr. Vinura Udaraka, who is also a Videography Volunteer at CITeS Lab, University of Moratuwa. The workshop’s contents included an introduction to audio capturing and editing, methods of audio capturing and audio editing with Adobe Audition along with video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
