                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">The workshop on Computer Networking, which was held at the University of Moratuwa, saw the participation of more than a hundred budding engineers, who undoubtedly found the programâ€™s content much enlightening and useful for their academics while serving as a pillar of strength for them to successfully survive once they enter the industrial arena where computer networking has taken up a vital position.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">The session was expertly facilitated by Mr. Nadeesha Ranaweera and Mr. Sarada Hettiarachchi, two distinguished professionals in the Networking industry from CISCO Networking Academy, University of Moratuwa. Important aspects such as the requirement of computer networking for various disciplines in engineering, network types, devices and protocols, paths to learning more about networking and the process of obtaining professional qualifications in networking were discussed, and the interactiveness of the workshop allowed the participants to obtain a better understanding of new concepts while clearing all the doubts and questions they had.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">The session successfully concluded amidst wonderful feedback from many participants who encouraged the IAS team to organize more workshops on areas that would be essential for an engineering professional to meet the demands of the fast-evolving industry. The IAS team is ready to meet their requests with the upcoming sessions of the workshop series.</p>
