Upon remembrance of IEEEâ€™s origin and to celebrate its worldwide membership, IEEE Day will be held on the first Tuesday in every October as inaugurated this month, back in 1884. This event celebration is the place where the engineers worldwide and IEEE associate members are gathered to share their innovative technical ideas on all perspectives of serving the community.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">Commemoration of IEEE Day by the members of IEEE Student Branch, University of Moratuwa in a grand scale was first initiated in the year 2019 by organizing a celebration with the participation of over 200 IEEE and non-IEEE members of University of Moratuwa and other institutions in the area.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">This grand event was held with the motive of increasing awareness on IEEE and inspiring young tech enthusiasts to join the organization. .All participants were made aware of how to volunteer with IEEE, advantages of getting IEEE membership, opportunities in IEEE and how to be a giant in IEEE. During the event, the 10th anniversary of IEEE was celebrated by cutting a specially made cake.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">Several informative sessions related to the theme of the IEEE Day were held where the insights and knowledge of nationally recognized professionals were shared with the participants. Different fun and entertainment activities were also held during the event in order to lighten up the day while entertaining the audience.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">Proving the fact that IEEE Student Branch, University of Moratuwa do not forget the humanitarian cause that they have to fulfil towards the world, a plat donation program was held in collaboration with the event as a solution to the giant global issue of deforestation. Due to the recent fires which were occurred in the Amazon rainforest and Ella forest areas, deforestation became a global issue. In order to encourage the younger generation in this aspect, the Student Branch donated some valuable and endangered plants for the Nature Team of the University of Moratuwa as an effort to fulfil our social responsibility, along with the celebration.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">This was able to bring a valuable victory to the Student Branch by winning the first place from the Social category in the IEEE Day Photo Contest 2019.</p>
