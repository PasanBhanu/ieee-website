                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">With the intention of promoting Biomedical Engineering in Sri Lanka, the session was successfully done by giving a brief knowledge about Biomedical Engineering and inspiring the undergraduates. The seminar was held on 28th November 2019 at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa under the topic of “Rapid wide field multiphoton microscopy through scattering tissue.” </p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">The guest speaker was Dr. Dushan Wadduwage who is a John Harvard Distinguished Science Fellow in Imaging at Harvard University, United States.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">In this session, the participants got to know the remarkable people in this field and their attempts, achievements which inspired the members a lot to become a giant in this field and how to achieve it step by step. Also, the key speech was filled with the potential of making the audience more attentive and interested in the field since Dr. Wadduwage shared his experiences in the research discipline.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted h5 font-weight-normal">The event was a great success which developed new insights into the mind of listeners.
